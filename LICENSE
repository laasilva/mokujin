mokujin_rng – Weighted Rarity RNG / Provably Fair Loot System
Copyright (C) 2025 laasilva

This library implements a weighted-rarity random-selection algorithm and an
optional provably-fair variant based on cryptographic hashing.  It allows
applications to define item rarities with weights, roll deterministic or
verifiable outcomes, and fairly select items from configurable pools.
